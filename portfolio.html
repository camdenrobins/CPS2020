    <h1>   Our project idea was to create a sun that moved across the screen then turn into a moon after it got to the other side, then the moon would move across the screen and once it reached the other side it would turn into the sun, and repeat.
Project Design. We designed trees with loops and a sun that would move during the day and transition to a moon once it was night. This cycle was put into an infinite loop to represent the accurate daily process within the day.</h1>
